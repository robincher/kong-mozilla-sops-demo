# Kong x Mozilla SOPS Demo

## Introduction

Demo repository on using Mozilla SOPs to encrupt secrets during Kong deployment and configurations.

## Requirements

1. Install [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/releases)
2. Install [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases)

We tested this exercise in MacOS, some variation are expected

## Walkthrough

### Generate a key-pair

Let's generate a key pair using age. Pl As you might expect with any other encryption scheme, the public key is the one we use to encrypt (and itâ€™s okay to share), while the secret key decrypts data (and must be kept private, recommend to use a password manager).

```
age-keygen -o sops-key.txt
Public key: xxxx

cat sops-key.txt
AGE-SECRET-KEY-XXXXXXXXXX
```

### Configuring Mozilla SOPS
Next, make encryption easier by creating a small configuration file for SOPS. This allows you to encrypt quickly without telling SOPS which key you want to use. 

Create a .sops.yaml file like this one in the root directory of our repository

```
creation_rules:
  - encrypted_regex: '^(data|stringData)$'
    age: xxxxx-age-public-key
```


### Create a sample Kong Config file

Let's create a sample Kong configuration,and encrypt it using the private key (remember, do not share it)
